<b> DESCRIPTION </b> <br>
 The code contains 3 functions to <br>1) simulate an overhand shuffle to set the amount of cards dropped from the shuffling hand per movement, <br>2) run a randomness test to check for consecutive colours in a sequence, <br>3) a Shannon Entropy score measuring the relative distance of cards from a new deck. <br>
 The results are plots for colour randomness and position randomness
